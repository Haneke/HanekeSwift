Haneke is a lightweight *generic* cache for iOS and tvOS written in Swift 5. It's designed to be super-simple to use. Here's how you would initalize a JSON cache and fetch objects from a url:

```swift
let cache = Cache<JSON>(name: "github")
let URL = NSURL(string: "https://api.github.com/users/haneke")!

cache.fetch(URL: URL).onSuccess { JSON in
    print(JSON.dictionary?["bio"])
}
```

Haneke provides a memory and LRU disk cache for `UIImage`, `NSData`, `JSON`, `String` or any other type that can be read or written as data.

Particularly, Haneke excels at working with images. It includes a zero-config image cache with automatic resizing. Everything is done in background, allowing for fast, responsive scrolling. Asking Haneke to load, resize, cache and display an *appropriately sized image* is as simple as:

```swift
imageView.hnk_setImageFromURL(url)
```

_Really._

## Features

* Generic cache with out-of-the-box support for `UIImage`, `NSData`, `JSON` and `String`
* First-level memory cache using `NSCache`
* Second-level LRU disk cache using the file system
* Asynchronous [fetching](#fetchers) of original values from network or disk
* All disk access is performed in background
* Thread-safe
* Automatic cache eviction on memory warnings or disk capacity reached
* Comprehensive unit tests
* Extensible by defining [custom formats](#formats), supporting [additional types](#supporting-additional-types) or implementing [custom fetchers](#custom-fetchers)

For images:

* Zero-config `UIImageView` and `UIButton` extensions to use the cache, optimized for `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` cell reuse
* Background image resizing and decompression

## Installation

Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'HanekeSwift'
```

Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage):

```
github "Haneke/HanekeSwift"
```

Using [SwiftPM](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) or [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio):


```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.11.2")),
```

Then link `Haneke` in your App target like so:

```swift
.target(
    name: "App",
    dependencies: [
        "Haneke",
    ]
),
```

Manually:

1. Drag `Haneke.xcodeproj` to your project in the _Project Navigator_.
2. Select your project and then your app target. Open the _Build Phases_ panel.
3. Expand the _Target Dependencies_ group, and add `Haneke.framework`.
4. Click on the `+` button at the top left of the panel and select _New Copy Files Phase_. Set _Destination_ to _Frameworks_, and add `Haneke.framework`.
5. `import Haneke` whenever you want to use Haneke.

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+ or tvOS 9.1+
- Swift 5

## Using the cache

Haneke provides shared caches for `UIImage`, `NSData`, `JSON` and `String`. You can also create your own caches.

The cache is a key-value store. For example, here's how you would cache and then fetch some data.

```Swift
let cache = Shared.dataCache

cache.set(value: data, key: "funny-games.mp4")

// Eventually...

cache.fetch(key: "funny-games.mp4").onSuccess { data in
    // Do something with data
}
```

In most cases the value will not be readily available and will have to be fetched from network or disk. Haneke offers convenience `fetch` functions for these cases. Let's go back to the first example, now using a shared cache:

```Swift
let cache = Shared.JSONCache
let URL = NSURL(string: "https://api.github.com/users/haneke")!

cache.fetch(URL: URL).onSuccess { JSON in
   print(JSON.dictionary?["bio"])
}
```

The above call will first attempt to fetch the required JSON from (in order) memory, disk or `NSURLCache`. If not available, Haneke will fetch the JSON from the source, return it and then cache it. In this case, the URL itself is used as the key.

Further customization can be achieved by using [formats](#formats), [supporting additional types](#supporting-additional-types) or implementing [custom fetchers](#custom-fetchers).

## Extra â™¡ for images

Need to cache and display images? Haneke provides convenience methods for `UIImageView` and `UIButton` with optimizations for `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` cell reuse. Images will be resized appropriately and cached in a shared cache.

```swift
// Setting a remote image
imageView.hnk_setImageFromURL(url)

// Setting an image manually. Requires you to provide a key.
imageView.hnk_setImage(image, key: key)
```

The above lines take care of:

1. If cached, retrieving an appropriately sized image (based on the `bounds` and `contentMode` of the `UIImageView`) from the memory or disk cache. Disk access is performed in background.
2. If not cached, loading the original image from web/memory and producing an appropriately sized image, both in background. Remote images will be retrieved from the shared `NSURLCache` if available.
3. Setting the image and animating the change if appropriate.
4. Or doing nothing if the `UIImageView` was reused during any of the above steps.
5. Caching the resulting image.
6. If needed, evicting the least recently used images in the cache.

## Formats

Formats allow to specify the disk cache size and any transformations to the values before being cached. For example, the `UIImageView` extension uses a format that resizes images to fit or fill the image view as needed.

You can also use custom formats. Say you want to limit the disk capacity for icons to 10MB and apply rounded corners to the images. This is how it could look like:

```swift
let cache = Shared.imageCache

let iconFormat = Format<UIImage>(name: "icons", diskCapacity: 10 * 1024 * 1024) { image in
    return imageByRoundingCornersOfImage(image)
}
cache.addFormat(iconFormat)

let URL = NSURL(string: "http://haneke.io/icon.png")!
cache.fetch(URL: URL, formatName: "icons").onSuccess { image in
    // image will be a nice rounded icon
}
```

Because we told the cache to use the `"icons"` format Haneke will execute the format transformation in background and return the resulting value.

Formats can also be used from the `UIKit` extensions:

```swift
imageView.hnk_setImageFromURL(url, format: iconFormat)
```

## Fetchers

The `fetch` functions for urls and paths are actually convenience methods. Under the hood Haneke uses fetcher objects. To illustrate, here's another way of fetching from a url by explictly using a network fetcher:

```swift
let URL = NSURL(string: "http://haneke.io/icon.png")!
let fetcher = NetworkFetcher<UIImage>(URL: URL)
cache.fetch(fetcher: fetcher).onSuccess { image in
    // Do something with image
}
```

Fetching an original value from network or disk is an expensive operation. Fetchers act as a proxy for the value, and allow Haneke to perform the fetch operation only if absolutely necessary.

In the above example the fetcher will be executed only if there is no value associated with `"http://haneke.io/icon.png"` in the memory or disk cache. If that happens, the fetcher will be responsible from fetching the original value, which will then be cached to avoid further network activity.

Haneke provides two specialized fetchers: `NetworkFetcher<T>` and `DiskFetcher<T>`. You can also implement your own fetchers by subclassing `Fetcher<T>`.

### Custom fetchers

Through custom fetchers you can fetch original values from other sources than network or disk (e.g., Core Data), or even change how Haneke acceses network or disk (e.g., use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking instead of `NSURLSession`). A custom fetcher must subclass `Fetcher<T>` and is responsible for:

* Providing the key (e.g., `NSURL.absoluteString` in the case of `NetworkFetcher`) associated with the value to be fetched
* Fetching the value in background and calling the success or failure closure accordingly, both in the main queue
* Cancelling the fetch on demand, if possible

Fetchers are generic, and the only restriction on their type is that it must implement `DataConvertible`.

## Supporting additional types

Haneke can cache any type that can be read and saved as data. This is indicated to Haneke by implementing the protocols `DataConvertible` and `DataRepresentable`.

```Swift
public protocol DataConvertible {
    typealias Result

    class func convertFromData(data:NSData) -> Result?

}

public protocol DataRepresentable {

    func asData() -> NSData!

}
```

This is how one could add support for `NSDictionary`:

```Swift
extension NSDictionary : DataConvertible, DataRepresentable {

    public typealias Result = NSDictionary

    public class func convertFromData(data:NSData) -> Result? {
        return NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObjectWithData(data) as? NSDictionary
    }

    public func asData() -> NSData! {
        return NSKeyedArchiver.archivedDataWithRootObject(self)
    }

}
```

Then creating a `NSDictionary` cache would be as simple as:

```swift
let cache = Cache<NSDictionary>(name: "dictionaries")
```

## Roadmap

Haneke Swift is in initial development and its public API should not be considered stable.
